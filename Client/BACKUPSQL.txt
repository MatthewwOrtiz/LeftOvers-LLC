Meanwhile, at the F.E.A.S.T. shelter run by Martin Li (Mister Negative), the cancer-ridden Eddie Brock is miraculously healed. When the Thunderbolts track Spider-Man to the F.E.A.S.T. shelter, Brock reacts to the Venom Symbiote (currently bonded to Mac Gargan), transforming into Anti-Venom (a hero with the ability to heal others and purify diseases).

Anti-Venom fights Venom in a new, improved scorpion armor from Norman Osborn. "Venorpion" hits Anti-Venom with his stinger and injects a super-poisonous toxin into him that dissolves his suit . After a battle which results in a building collapsing, Songbird tells Spider-Man to lie low for the next few days.

  '"Steve Rogers wanted to fight nazis. He wanted to serve his country. An experimental serum gave him the power to do both. As Captain America, Rogers became a World War II battlefield legend... until the day a nazi missile hurled him into the icy waters of the North Atlantic. The cruelty of time left Rogers frozen for decades, his legend forgotten. But his country still needed him... and legends never die."

Captain America is fighting a group of masked villains with his shield. They are trying to take over a police station in Bouton, Nebraska, to get national attention endangering a group of students on a school trip in the process. Cap hides most of the students in a room, then finds the missing two, hidden under a desk. He tells them not to be scared and to wait for him: he proceeds to knock out most of the rogues, but one of them shoots him and the girl, Donna, decides to protect the hero with her own body. Cap manages to shield her at the last second, telling her he''s stronger, so he''s the one protecting her and not the other way around. He reveals he''s recently woken up from a long sleep (this story is, then, to be put in a distant past, in the very first days of the Avengers) and tells the kids to ask their grandparents for his name.

Ten years later, Steve Rogers goes back to Bouton only to realize they named the town he saved after him. It is today the 10th annual Captain America Celebration, so a Cap themed festival is ongoing. Steve is mistaken by everybody for a cosplay of himself, so he''s able to walk around undisturbed. He talks to a guy who thinks the story about Cap being frozen for decades is a scam; then everyone listens to witnesses on stage talking about the time they were saved by Cap.

Suddenly, a Rampart militia goes on stage and their leader declares they''re now ready for their plan and it''s only fitting to begin right where they started. As he orders to open fire on the crowd, Steve destroys the guns lined up with his shield, and puts on his mask. After subduing the group easily, Cap tells the leader he knew all along they were probably going to show up, so he got there to stop them. He threatens the foe to tell him more about his group, and he answers "You''ll learn more soon", blowing himself up.

Before leaving, Cap gives the people of the town an inspirational speech, in which he says: "We know what''s right. The strong protect the weak. Never forget that". Donna, now a grown girl, answers: "That''s the rule. Welcome back".',

This time, he''s in Sauga River, a small town near Atlanta. As he arrives, he speaks on the phone with Sharon Carter, telling her he''s fine and that should the Avengers need him, he''s "a Quinjet away". He then enters a diner, asking for a late lunch in exchange for washing their dishes. Everyone immediately recognizes him, so the owner refuses to have him pay his lunch in any way. He shoos the other customers harassing Steve for a photo with them, but it''s too late: one of them informed the media, who get there in no time.

Meanwhile, in Atlanta, a man dressed as the Swordsman watches the news and is informed of Cap''s arrival at Sauga River. He thinks he knows the reason why he''s here, so he brandishes his sword.

Joe, the owner of the diner, takes Steve through the back door and gives him a brief tour of the town, showing him the most relevant site, a huge dam that keeps the waters of the nearby river from flooding Sauga. Suddenly, Joe''s wife calls, informing the two that the new Swordsman has made a public challenge to Captain America: in twenty minutes he''ll open the main floodgate, washing away the whole town. Cap immediately dresses up and rides his bike to the location.

Swordsman clicks a button and immediately after that, Cap enters the control room of the dam. Swordsman is sure he got there because he wanted to shut him down before he could even reclaim the name of his predecessor, but Cap had actually no idea whatsoever of all that. As they start fighting, Swordsman reveals his sword is made of pure Vibranium (just like Cap''s shield), so it''s indestructible. The fight continues on top of the dam itself, but it suddenly opens and the water starts pouring out. Swordsman reveals he''d already preprogrammed it to open: he had said Cap would find him at the dam, not that he had a chance to stop him.

Cap knocks out the rogue, then understands with the operator that the only way to close the dam is with a manual override. Unfortunately, for all of Cap''s strength, it''s not enough to shut the control knob closed, so he has an idea: he''ll use the indestructible sword of the Swordsman as a lever. The plan actually works, stopping the flood from doing real damage, aside from a couple of basements and a playground getting destroyed.

At sunset, Cap is ready to leave for a new adventure, but, before that, he says goodbye to Joe and his wife, who give him her "chili specialty": once again Joe denies Cap paying them back, as he did enough for the town after all.

As he leaves on his motorcycle, a spear-armed shadow looks at him on top of a building... ',

Unfortunately, she turns out to be an accomplice of Kraven The Hunter''s, as she poisons Cap with a venomous scratch, turning him unconscious and leaving him for her boss''s schemes.

Steve wakes up in Kraven''s mansion, with an electrified collar round his neck. Cap realizes who his enemy is, as he heard Spider-Man talking about him, and the foe explains to him what''s going to happen: Cap will be left in the jungle below them and will have to find his way to the coast tagging along with a scared guy. Cap immediately jumps in the jungle and saves the other individual from a jaguar, killing the beast by throwing it in one of Kraven''s deadly traps. The man presents himself as David Cotter, and the two keep walking as Kraven shoots at them. As they survive numerous traps, Cotter seems incapable of not activating Kraven''s devices, causing Cap to start losing patience.

As they near the coast, Cotter tells Cap he felt a click under his foot, meaning he''s walked on a pressure mine. Cap immediately plans a way to free him without exploding the mine, but it turns out it was all a scam by Cotter, another accomplice of Kraven''s, to approach Cap unawares with a gun. Cap smells the gun oil, so he reacts in time and knocks Cotter out.

Behind them, Kraven appears, clapping at Cap''s ability to survive all his traps. As promised, Kraven accepts to give Cap his shield and his freedom, the freedom of blissful unconsciousness. As he shoots Cap with a dart, the hero loses his balance and falls off the coastal cliff, to Kraven''s despair: he was supposed to turn him in alive. Cap is actually still sentient, so he grabs Kraven''s foot and menaces him to turn off the collar, unless he wants both of them to fall on the rocks below. Kraven refuses to help and be helped, so he activates the collar and they both fall down, with Cap surviving the impact by falling into water on his shield. Suddenly, from the sea a huge submarine filled with Rampart militiamen emerges: while they are underwhelmed by Kraven''s performance, they activate a freezing cannon that imprisons Cap inside an ice-block and proceed to collect him on board.',

He has been taken over by King Babbington. Elsewhere, the Things slaves away to keep power on in Babbington’s tower.No, the Hulk and the Thing don’t get to fight in this one. I’m sad too.

However, this issue does continue to show how well Mark Waid and Chris Samnee understand Steve Rogers, how he thinks, and how he acts. Steve doesn’t immediately try to challenge the Hulk. He tries to get through to him or Banner first. He doesn’t ambush the Thing working away for Babbington; he lets him know the truth without assuming the worst.

Babbington’s elitism and implicit bigotry is played to classic supervillain effect, which actually fits in this story which does its best to capture the feeling of a classic Captain America tale. Admittedly, his physical abnormalities do muddy the intended message of the tale. He doesn’t even look like you-know-who.

There is an implied joke about how white supremacists do tend to not look so great, but even that is low-hanging fruit.

That aside, the comic’s pacing is refreshingly quick, and it concludes the current thrust of “Out of Time” in a cathartic fashion.',

  'Wolverine, under the control of Hydra, is slaughtering S.H.I.E.L.D. agents left and right onboard an aircraft carrier. Fortunately, he is soon neutralized by Elektra''s sais and she then tries to reason with him. Hydra''s "Plan B" kicks in as a bomb detonates on the ship, allowing Wolverine to escape and hitch a ride with a shark to the surface. This leaves Elektra trapped in a flooding chamber, but she manages to get into a radiation containment suit and also escapes. Later, Elektra informs some S.H.I.E.L.D. agents that Wolverine orchestrated the entire scenario to hack into their system mainframe. The Next day, Nick Fury gives a speech to a council of authorities about the pressing situation; explaining that the Hand have been targeting meta-humans to kill and reanimate them, so that they later become their obedient assassins. The council officially hires Elektra and their next move is to brief all superhumans on the problem, to make sure they are prepared for Wolverine. As Fury''s speech ends, Air Force One lands on the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. Meanwhile the X-Mansion has taken extra precaution to safeguard the students. Shadowcat calms the student''s fears before phasing past the security beams towards the room she will now temporarily share with Storm. At that moment, non-super beings are evacuated from the Baxter Building. Once the other Fantastic Four members are secure, Thing activates a forcefield over the building and declares it safe. However, Wolverine watches him menacingly from an air vent. ',

  'Wolverine, under Hydra''s influence, has infiltrated the Baxter Building and now spies on the Fantastic Four. Unaware of this, Mr. Fantastic convenes with Tony Stark and Hank Pym in a secret area of "non-space". Where the three geniuses discuss Reed''s newest invention: a potentially dangerous "Terraformer" intended for wiping out world hunger. Suddenly, Reed discovers that their sanctum is being hacked and announces Wolverine''s location in the Data Room. The Human Torch grabs hold of Wolverine''s wrists, searing flesh and nerves to prevent him from unsheathing his claws. However, Logan overrides their system''s protocols and sprays Johnny with the building''s fire extinguishers. Wolverine then combats the Thing but again comes out victorious. Reed manages to detain their foe with his malleable body, before Hydra teleports Wolverine sixty feet away; right in front of the Invisible Woman. After alerting S.H.I.E.L.D. of the conflict, Sue blinds and suffocates him with her assortment of abilities. Then a Hydra vehicle crashes through a wall and save Logan, with the Human Torch in "hot" pursuit. The two men collide into a nearby building, and when ambulances arrive, Wolverine again escapes under the guise of an injured Human Torch. The Fantastic Four survey the damage and spot Johnny safely walking away from the wreckage. The fire-fighters, however, are too late in saving the ambulance staff from Wolverine''s rampage. Back at Hydra Headquarters, Baron von Strucker acts upon Logan''s successful mission; contacting AIM and the Hand, and planning an assault on the heart of the American Banking Industry. ',

  'High into the sky, an airliner begins its final descent into Gotham. On the ground, Batman and Commissioner Gordon talk about Kobra’s recent theft of three military missiles. Two were recovered by the GCPD, but the third one has been fired on the airliner and causes it to plummet towards the ground. With Duke’s help, Batman tracks the plane’s fall in the Batmobile. Alfred informs Batman the Justice League is unavailable, but Batman is not concerned. Gotham is his city and he will save it.

Using the Batmobile’s ejector seat, Batman reaches the falling plane and hangs onto one of its wings. At the same time, Gordon attempts to evacuate the majorly populated areas. The estimated crash site will be the Kane Plaza. Batman’s plane is to stabilize the plane enough to land it in the water. He attaches thrusters into the plane’s wings, effectively turning the airliner into the new Batplane.

To steer the plane and save the passengers, Batman must remain on top of the plane at all times, which means he will take the full force of the collision and get killed. Solemnly, Alfred promises to pass his regrets to his allies and Batman asks him if his mom and dad would be proud of him. Alfred sadly assures him they are, and this is a good death for a hero like him.

Suddenly, against all odds, the plane slows down and lands gently on Gotham’s harbor. It has been saved by two figures resembling Superman and Supergirl. They are Gotham and Gotham Girl, and much like Batman, they are here to save their city.',

  'Gotham City. Park Row. Then. A family of three walking from a movie theatre heads into an alley. It looks like the same-old Batman origin story, but something isn’t quite right. Along with the scenes, an unknown narrator talks about growing up in Gotham. The family get stopped by a man with a gun. The father tries to talk the assailant down, but he gets punched him in the stomach. The assailant then comes after the mother; the son is crying. The assailant grabs the gold chain around the mother’s neck and points his gun at her like he’s going to shoot, but he is stopped by Batman who shouts “NO.” Batman tells the family, specifically the boy, that they’re going to be scared for awhile, which is fine because everyone gets scared. But it also gives everyone an opportunity to be brave and fight the fear.

Gotham City. Robbinsville. Now. The father from the attempted robbery, whose name is Henry Clover, was the narrator talking about growing up in Gotham. He is telling his story to an FBI agent, who is there asking about Henry’s children, Hank and Claire. Henry tells how after the attempted robbery, Hank became obsessed with Batman and helping people. Claire, who was at a friend’s house at the time of the robbery, does whatever her older brother does. Hank and Claire began helping people, however they could. When they weren’t helping, they were training. Last year, they went overseas for charity work; they had their dad wire them some money, for what he doesn’t know. When they came back last month, Gotham City now had Gotham and Gotham Girl. The FBI agent is interested in the payment. When Mrs. Clover asks the agents name again, he says that it’s Matches Malone.

“Agent Malone”, who is really Bruce Wayne is disguise, leaves the Clovers’ house and is told by Alfred that a suicide bomber has attacked the Vincefinkle Bridge during rush hour while shouting “The Monster Men are coming.” Bruce’s car splits in half and out comes the Batcycle with Bruce in full Batman costume. Bruce is four minutes away.

Meanwhile, Gotham and Gotham Girl are at the bridge saving people. Gotham doesn’t think he can hold the bridge up much longer, but Gotham Girl says it’s “ok” because Batman is there.

Meanwhile, another narrator is talking to Ms. Waller about Gotham City, and its people learning to ignore, embrace, and become the horrors. It’s Hugo Strange.

Back at the bridge, Batman tells Gotham and Gotham girls that while he runs down the leads, they will watch the city. Gotham thanks Batman for helping them and tries to tell him about the time in the alley; Batman interrupts by telling him it’s good to see what he did with his fear as Batman leaves the scene. Gotham Girl points out that Batman let them see him leave this time. Another bomb goes off. Gotham Girl says they should have a rallying cry to which Gotham points out that Batman doesn’t have one. Gotham Girl asks Gotham that if Batman jumped off a bridge, would he? To which Gotham points out that Batman just did jump off a bridge.

Gotham and Gotham Girl arrive at the building where the bomb went off. Gotham Girl tries another rallying cry to which Gotham says it’s growing on him. The run into Hugo Strange and the Psycho-Pirate, who is the master of emotions, including theirs.',
  'You feel each blow to the city as a blow to your own body. And you wonder when you, too, might fall. But that, Ms. Waller, is merely an illusion, a rather nifty trick of the mind. It is how the people of this city accept what they cannot accept. Indeed, what they should not accept. It lullabies them into complicity. Teaches them to ignore the horrors. To embrace the horrors. To become the horrors. It is our goal, then, to eliminate this illusion. To free the people from the psychosis of the city. They will not riot! They will resist! They will not panic! They will persevere! Villains will surrender. Heroes will triumph. And with my coaxing and Roger''s gifts... they will finally separate the life of the mind from the rot of the city. And they will declare... I am not Gotham. I am better than Gotham.',

Elsewhere, Gotham is trying to talk a man down from suicide. Law enforcement and firemen are standing by behind them. Gotham tells the man about to commit suicide that everyone is afraid and that the fear gives everyone a chance to be brave. Gotham says they can fix this. The man thanks Gotham, telling him he wasn’t sure if he could do it. He presses “detonate” on his phone and says “The Monster Men are coming.” The bomb goes off, killing the bomber and everyone else there besides Gotham.

Meanwhile, in the Batcave, Claire is screaming. Alfred offers her coffee and when she yells “NO!” he says then perhaps tea. Duke offers her a blanket and some comfort, but is interrupted by Batman who demands Duke’s analysis of the crime scene NOW.

Elsewhere, Gotham is repeating “I can fix this” to himself. Batman arrives and tries to tell Gotham that right now he can’t fix it. Gotham screams that Batman doesn’t know what he can do and throws the steel beam that he was holding at the Batmobile, destroying the car. Batman says that he thought he knew what Gotham could do before he came across those twenty-seven dead bodies in a burning building. Gotham flies away screaming “NO!” Duke contacts Batman and asks him if he should send the pattern he found to the car. Batman, who is standing in front of the destroyed Batmobile, tells him that no, he should not send it to the car. As Batman grabs a backpack from the Batmobile and flies away while blowing up the car, Duke tells him that all the dog tags add up to twenty-four, which is the letter of the unit, meaning Task Force “X” a.k.a. the Suicide Squad.

Elsewhere, Sam Lane is telling Amanda Waller that they don’t need to worry about Batman. He claims that even if Batman somehow connects the incident to them, that where they’re at isn’t in the books and therefore Batman can’t find them. Waller looks up from her phone to tell Lane and the damn Bat-man is standing right behind him. Batman takes out Lane and tells Waller that it’s time they talked. Waller points out that ever since Batman arrived, Gotham has been on fire, and she’s been tasked with putting out the flames. She tells Batman that Hugo Strange and Psycho-Pirate were working for her, but Strange betrayed her and used Psycho-Pirate to control Gotham and cause him to kill her soldiers. Waller says she’ll work with Batman, but only if he says “Please”. Batman says her that twenty-seven people are dead and she wants him to say please? Waller tells him that it was twenty-eight people.

Batman finds Gotham at his parents’ house, standing over their dead bodies, holding the twenty-eighth man in his grasp. Batman figured out that the twenty-eighth soldier was still alive and when Gotham, who hadn’t realized that, took his mask off. The soldier then took Hank''s picture, figured out his identity, and came after Hank’s parents. Batman tries to convince Gotham not to kill the soldier, stating that this is Psycho-Pirate’s doing, but Gotham snaps the soldier’s neck. Gotham mentions that the Monster Men are always coming, and that Gotham City destroys everything. Gotham says that he can’t fix Gotham, but he can kill it before it hurts anyone else as he flies off, leaving Batman behind.',

She starts telling it, but it’s the same joke she told before. She tells Hank she’s not feeling so good. Batman shows up and tells her that he’s not trying to help her, rather he needs her help, like she helps the city. Batman tells her he needs to know why she is helping the city. Gotham Girl says it hurts when you’re alone, and helping Gotham makes it hurt less. Batman pulls his cowl off and tells Claire that he’s Bruce Wayne; he tells her about his parents and how he talked to his mother after she was dead, and that he still does. Bruce holds Claire as she cries.

Sunday. Batman is meeting with Amanda Waller to ask for her help. She tells him that if he wants this, then he works for her. It turns out that Strange was working for Bane, and Bane now has Psycho-Pirate in Santa Prisca. Waller tells Batman that he has to invade a powerful, sovereign country, break into the most secure prison, and pry a lunatic out of the hands of a monster… and she has a way to do it. However, if his does go, it will be suicide.

  'Hurricane Milton is heading for Gotham City. Meanwhile, at the Tolliver Memorial Morgue, something is happening to the bodies.

In the City, Batman, Batwoman, and Nightwing are preparing for the hurricane. Batwoman and Nightwing think that Batman is pushing himself too hard, but Batman says he refuses to lose anyone else. He points out that they need to find a better way like Red Robin would have.

Meanwhile in the Cauldron, Dr. Strange says that it’s time to start, and that it’s Batman’s final night. The bodies in the morgue start mutating grotesquely.

Over in Old Gotham, Jim Gordon is conversing with Batman. He says that his officers can’t be seen openly working with Batman and his recruits because they are considered fugitives. Batman says that they need to all work together. Spoiler, Clayface, and Orphan enter the scene in record time, for which Batman praises them. Batman injects Clayface with something that will help keep him stable. They’re sending all the people from the at-risk areas to the caves at Olsen Park to wait out the floods. Batman sends Spoiler and Orphan to the caves to keep order while himself, Batwoman, Nightwing, and Clayface (who can be in more than one place at the same time) head the evacuation. Clayface is unsure he can keep so many forms for so long, but after a short pep-talk from Batwoman, he says it’ll last “long enough”.

They get interrupted by a loud crashing noise – a giant monster is attacking Gotham. Batman goes after the Monster with the Batplane. It gets destroyed in the process and also sets off enough paralytic gas to take out a double-decker bus. The gas has no effect, and the monster grabs Batman (who is currently flying using the combat capsule) and flings Batman into the air. When Batman reaches the Monster again, he ejects himself from the combat capsule and blows it up to take the monster down. Batman sends the DNA data from the monster to the cave and it comes back human, but heavily modified. The DNA comes from a man named Robert Castro, a man who killed himself while in Hugo Strange’s care (and mentioned the Monster Men right before doing so).

Another loud rumble and people running away in panic. It’s another giant creature; the Monster Men are here.

',
  'My God. It''s... There''s no other word for it, Master Bruce... We''ve seen terrible things before, but this...it''s...it''s a monster.',

  'Duke wants to suit up and help Batman on the streets; Batman needs him to be his eyes and ears. Spoiler and Orphan are still out of contact. Duke can tell that there’s something wrong with Nightwing and Gotham Girl since Nightwing’s heartrate spiked and they are also not responding. Duke and Alfred figured out that the steroid that caused the Monster Men have some similarities to venom and that they cause massive bioelectric surges – just like the reading he’s getting off Nightwing.

A monster tosses Batman up in the air; Batwoman saves him and blows up her bike in the Monster’s mouth. Batman grumbles that he had a plan. Nightwing and Gotham Girl, transformed by Strange’s monster, arrive in the city. Batman wants to take care of Nightwing and Gotham Girl, but Batwoman won’t let him because he’s too close to them. Batwoman quips that she’s been training the rest of the family and now it’s time for their lesson.

Duke says that he might have a way to help Nightwing and Gotham Girl; Batman isn’t happy about it. Meanwhile, Batman confronts Gotham Girl. He apologizes to her for everything he’s gone through. He says that he let the fight take Red Robin and her brother, but he wouldn’t let it take her too. In order to do that, he has to stop the monster that she’s become. Clayface forms a protective suit around Batman and they fight as one. Duke arrives on the scene claiming to have a cure.

Back in the cave, Spoiler’s and Orphan’s plan to burn away the algae works and the people return to normal as the slithers away… towards the giant monster outside their cave!

On the streets, Duke administers the cure to Gotham Girl and she expels the monster blood from her system. Meanwhile, Batwoman is fighting the monster-Nightwing. She becomes wounded and is in free-fall.

',
  'Gotham Girl. I''m sorry this happened to you. Psycho-Pirate infected you with fear. That monster at Blackgate transformed you into this creature. Red Robin. You. And your brother.

  'At Santa Prisca, Bane''s kingdom, Bane tells the Psycho-Pirate the story of his youth as a captive in that same place and explains that he still finds himself screaming because of that. He once turned to Venom to get comfort, but not anymore. Now he wants the Pirate to use his powers to make him feel happy and brave, and to let him know he "can always stop". The Pirate puts the Medusa Mask on and carries on Bane''s will.

At Wayne Manor, Bruce sits at the side of Claire''s bed, worried about her mental conditions, as she seems to be slipping into a chronic depression. Bruce makes up his mind and communicates his decision to Alfred: he''ll accept Amanda Waller''s proposition and heads to Arkham Asylum, promising he''ll cure Gotham Girl.

At the Asylum, Batman starts gathering rogues for a sort of task force similar, under many aspects, to the Suicide Squad. The first one admitted is Arnold Wesker, a.k.a. The Ventriloquist. Batman promises him he''ll be moved to a luxury facility if he helps and, as his alter-ego Scarface is currently gone, he''s free to decide on "his" own. Wesker answers "Whatever you say", showing that Scarface may be gone, but he still needs a commanding personality making choices for him.

While arguing with Dr. Arkham to get three more accomplices instead of two, Batman passes on the cells of Kite-Man, Condiment King, Tweedledum and Tweedledee, Calendar Man and Jane Doe, who draws a symbol on her prison-glass.

Batman has a friendly scuffle with an old acquaintance, Bronze Tiger, who joins the team. Next up is Jewlee, whose cause for her catatonic state seems to be the disappearence of her lover, Punch. Batman calls Gordon, who''s been following since the beginning of the "tour" inside the cell and proceeds to punch him in the face. He is, in fact, Punch in disguise, who escaped from Santa Prisca and infiltrated Arkham Asylum today to see his loved one. Batman is actually impressed with this show of will for love and accepts them both along.

After this, Arkham refuses to give Batman another inmate. Batman fights back with two main reasons to his favor: one, Dr. Arkham doesn''t want people to know Punch managed to infiltrate the Asylum that easily; two, Batman brought in pretty much every psychopath in Arkham, so the doctor has no right to tell him what he can''t do.

Batman then enters one last cell and chooses his last entry in the team: Selina Kyle, a.k.a. Catwoman, who''s been charged with death by lethal injection for the murder of 237 people.

',
  'I''ve been thinking lately. About you and me. How you may be the only one who understands what I''m doing. Bane. He has something...something I want. Something I will take from him. To do it, I''ll break the laws I need to break. I''ll use the people I need to use. I will do whatever needs to be done. And I will never stop',

  'Onboard his Batwing, Batman enters the airspace of Santa Prisca and is warned that if he doesn''t land immediately and surrender to the forces on ground, he''ll be shot out of the sky. Batman simply repeats a mantra: "Bane. I''ve come for Psycho-Pirate. I need him to save someone who needs to be saved. Turn him over, I go away. Refuse to turn him over... and I will break your damn back".

As announced, the aerial security shoots the Batwing out of the sky: as Batman crashes at the entrance of the stronghold, he''s greeted by Bane''s men, who assault him and take him to their boss. Batman is a bath of blood and Bane explains that without his Venom he''s not going to be capable of snapping his spine like he did before, but he still performs a wrestling move that cracks it. Then, he drags an unconscious Batman to the underground cell he spent his youth in, and closes him in.

Batman comes to while rats eat at his face and water is starting to rise. He screams in pain and punches the wall with a specific intent: to create cavities to climb. As he once again repeats his mantra, he starts climbing the wall and, with a scream, he straightens his back. He falls back into the water, which is rising dangerously. Letting it get him close to the bars of his cell, Batman opens the door with the blades on his forearms. He then emerges from the cell, opening the prison’s entrance door for Catwoman and the Ventriloquist, who were waiting for him. This was Batman''s plan all along, with a simple goal at the end of it: to break Bane''s damn back.

  'In the past, Batman is chasing Catwoman on the roofs of Gotham City: she has to be taken to prison on account of the allegation of 237 murders on her. As he finally grabs her arm, she says that if he does that, if he takes her in, what''s between them will stop forever. Batman, helpless, replies: "Cat, what am I supposed to do?".

In the present, Batman is helping up Catwoman, who apparently slipped while walking in the sewers of Bane''s fortress. At a crossroads, Batman decides to split up the team: he''ll go to the left, while Catwoman and the Ventriloquist go to the right. They will arrive, according to Punch, in Cell Block D, which is the most secure section of the prison and, thus, probably where Bane keeps the Psycho-Pirate. Batman especially stresses the importance of Wesker in his scheme, so he needs to stay alive no matter what.

In another section of Santa Prisca, Punch, Jewlee and Bronze Tiger are waiting to be let in by Bane himself. As the couple flirts and teases Turner, he threatens them to shut up or else... suddenly, a soldier invites them in.

While climbing up pipes, Catwoman asks Wesker to tell her the truth: his doll, Scarface, must be just a farce, something he uses to hide himself. Wesker seems to not understand what she says, as he genuinely considers Scarface an autonomous identity who makes him do bad things. He''s glad Scarface has left him alone for some time now, and Catwoman argues that he''s lucky: her inner lynx never lets go. They arrive at Cell Block D, so Wesker assumes they have to do what they were told by Batman, but Catwoman has other plans. She knows this mission won''t save her from getting executed, so she decides to go "cat around a bit", ordering Wesker to stay there. He complies gladly.

With Batman watching the scene through the grating of a ceiling vent directly over Bane''s throne room, Bronze Tiger acts as if he wanted to offer Punch and Jewlee to Bane in order to get advice from him on how to kill Batman, as he''s the one who got closest. Bane is glad to get back one of his inmates, but suddenly Catwoman attacks her ally Bronze Tiger and apparently cuts Punch''s and Jewlee''s throats. She reveals everything to Bane, who''s shocked to hear that Batman actually made it out of his cell. Catwoman has knocked out the three of them, so she now approaches Bane with her requests: she wants a plane, money and help to disappear. In exchange, she''ll tell Bane how to break the Bat.

  'The current situation at Santa Prisca is as follows: Ventriloquist is waiting for directives in the sewers, as he was told by Catwoman; Punch and Jewlee are down and Bane''s men are dragging them away. Bronze Tiger has been taken to a cell with other inmates; Batman himself is on his knees, at the feet of Bane''s throne. Beside the foe are Catwoman and the man Batman needs to save Gotham Girl, and the whole reason the team got there, Psycho-Pirate.

Back at the Batcave, Alfred is rubbing a glass case when Amanda Waller suddenly comes in. She suggests that it was always her plan to get Batman there by "unfortunately" losing control of Hugo Strange and the Pirate, so that she could get some files undisturbed.

In Santa Prisca, Bane understands that breaking Batman physically is inproductive, so he''ll try something else. He explains that he knows why Batman does what he does, because they''re the same: he, too, went looking for "a monster" once. And they do that because they don''t have the guts to pull the trigger on their heads, so they find a monster and try to die in his arms. But that ends now, because Bane says he found a cure: the Psycho-Pirate is able to turn one''s emotions the way he pleases, so he was able to make Bane better and the same will go for Batman. Bane only asks of Batman to tell him what he wants, but Batman answers: "I want to break your damn back", infuriating his enemy. Meanwhile, Bronze Tiger bought some Venom from an inmate and is now able to break free of the cell, crawl through an air vent and reach Bane''s throne room with the Ventriloquist; Punch and Jewlee, who got apparently killed by Catwoman, stand up and talk about clothing, dogs and having a kid, while they make big bubbles with chewing gum: as the chewing gum explodes around them, creating a protective layer, they burn the room they were taken to and jump out the window in the sea. With a signal from Batman, Catwoman suddenly attacks Bane, kicking him in the back.

Batman orders Bronze Tiger to lock the door as Bane''s men will be coming, while Ventriloquist must take care of the Psycho-Pirate. The Pirate is amused at the idea that the fat, old man could get him, but he doesn''t know the whole point behind Batman taking him along: as Wesker is in danger, Scarface (his other identity that emerges as a ventriloquist''s puppet) punches the Pirate in the face, as the only one who can control Wesker. The Ventriloquist himself is then knocked out by Bronze Tiger. Catwoman blows up a wall of the prison and the team finds outside, waiting, Punch and Jewlee on a bubble-gum rubber boat. Batman stops for a moment to talk to the defeated enemy: in the next few days he may be tempted to seek out his monster, but he really should listen to his own words and stay safe.

On the boat, Batman assures that his promises will be kept for everyone. Then, he and Catwoman kiss, but they both know they can''t have a life together.

Bane, defeated, is reached by his soldiers. They ask what he needs and he screams: VENOM!

After the events at Santa Prisca, where she helped Batman subdue and take Psycho-Pirate away, she''s been granted a life sentence in prison instead of her death penalty. He intends to take her to Blackgate tonight; she has other ideas in mind, as she kisses him under the stars. Catwoman turns away from him, saying that she wants this night, only this night, which shines like a diamond, then they can take her life. Batman is convinced that she didn''t actually kill 237 people and he intends to prove it, but she needs to comply and do what she''s told: if he lets her have the night, she''ll surely run away and he''ll surely run after her. Catwoman manages to persuade him to spend a night together and as she suggests to do that between sheets, he sees the Bat-Signal, meaning they have work to do.

In a clocktower, Clock King explains to Batman that he''s been preparing for this confrontation for four years, meaning the only possible outcome is his death: unfortunately, the villain hadn''t considered one variable, Catwoman, who crashes through the clock window and knocks him out. She hopes this means they''re free to spend the night otherwise, but... Gotham''s villains never sleep. Batman and Catwoman take on a plethora of minor villains, including -and concluding with- Kite-Man (Hell yeah!).

Now that they have done what Batman likes, it''s Catwoman''s turn: they break into an apartment, property of a Holly Robinson, to steal the Victoria Cat, an artifact that was stolen from the Gotham Museum of Fine Arts four years before. Turns out that Holly Robinson is actually Catwoman herself, who played a prank on Batman and now suggests him to jump off the window to evade an explosion triggered by the removal of the artifact from its place.

Back on the rooftops, Catwoman rips the Cat apart and gives Batman a handful of diamonds to build a dozen orphanages with. But first, as she scatters the diamonds on the ground, they will stop doing what they have to do and spend some time doing what they want to. They undress each other and make love under the light of the stars and the Bat-signal.',

Batman and Catwoman sleep under the stars on a rooftop, both naked, after a long night. They playfully argue about the first time they met: he says it was when she -dressed up as an old woman- tried to steal a diamond; she says it was when he -dressed up as a scarred vagrant- tried to save her friend. Waking up, they kiss and Selina says she loves him. He loves her back.

As the two lovers dress up, Catwoman jumps off the roof, challenging Batman to catch her. Batman can''t find her, so he calls Alfred and asks about a Holly Robinson: during the night Catwoman had told him it was an alias, but then she talked about a friend of hers by that name, so she must be linked to her in some way.

Commissioner Gordon watches himself in the mirror: as he brushes his teeth, he tells himself he''s going to die if he doesn''t stop sleeping so little and smoking so much. Suddenly, Batman appears behind him, startling him. Batman needs informations about Holly Robinson, which he now knows was an orphan at Wayne House. Gordon calls Harvey Bullock to have a judge open her files.

At her apartment, Holly Robinson tries to go back to sleep when Batman makes his appearance behind her, asking where is Catwoman. Batman explains that he needs to find her and that they love each other: Holly answers she has a phone to call her in case of emergency and reaches for it in a drawer. In reality, she reaches for a knife and slits Batman''s throat, leaving him on the ground for dead. After a while, Batman wakes up, visibly impaired, as Alfred tells him that Holly is about to take a flight to Kahndaq. Batman tries to fly away with his Bat-rope, but ends up falling off the balcony and is saved by Catwoman herself.

At Wayne Manor, Selina explains how she trained Holly and how it was she who killed the 237 people after their orphanage was burned down. Bruce is unconscious, with a bandage on his neck, so Selina tells Alfred that when he''ll want to meet with her she''ll be on the rooftops, as usual.

Batman, back to work in the Batcave, tells Alfred that Selina managed to steal something from him: the night itself.',

  'Wonder Woman reminisces her latest battle with Cheetah. In hindsight, she realizes it marked the end of a chapter and the beginning of another darker.

Not long ago Veronica Cale was working in her office in Empire Enterprises when she was visited by an hologram of Doctor Cyber. Veronica believed their partnership was over after their last quarrel, but Cyber thought she might be interested in knowing Cheetah has escaped from wherever Wonder Woman held her captive. Veronica, who swore to hunt Cheetah down after getting almost killed by her, is definitely interested.

Present day. Doctor Poison is heading into the Empire Industries'' sub-basement. Empire Industries managed to recapture Cheetah, but Barbara Minerva has just slipped into a sudden coma. Poison intends to run more tests, but Cheetah has nearly flatlined.

Cheetah comes around abruptly and violently. Cheetah tears her restrains off and escapes from the lab, killing and hurting whoever crosses her path as roaring Urzkartaga isn''t the only god. The dark gods are coming.

Cheetah fights her way up to Veronica Cale''s office, unimpeded, and is about to throw Veronica off the balcony when Wonder Woman shoves her off Veronica. Wonder Woman will not allow her to kill anybody, not even Cale, but Cheetah replies Veronica''s tampering with her transformation is an insult to Urzkartaga. If she avenges that insult by killing Cale, she''ll be free from Urzkartaga and ready to face the next gods.

Wonder Woman lunges again, attempting talk Cheetah down or at least hold her down, but she abruptly stops when she sees several humongous shadows silhouetted against the sky. Shaken, Wonder Woman demands to know if Cheetah drugged her. However Cheetah is too angry to pay attention to her words since Veronica took advantage of their battle to run away. Cheetah declares Wonder Woman must pay, too, before jumping off the building and vanishing somehow.

Meanwhile, in Montenegro Jason breaks his adoptive father Glaucus from a Kobra''s Research Base. As Jason flies his father to safety, he explains he now owns an armor which gives him extra powers, although he can only wield one at a time. Jason doesn''t know how he got it because one week of his life has been erased from his memory. Glaucus notes he can see that armor giving off power signatures of all Greek gods.

Back on Washington, D.C., Wonder Woman receives a call from Steve Trevor as she is flying over Washington DC in hopes of locating Cheetah. Tens of thousands of people are going mad all over the planet, swearing off their gods and rioting furiously as claiming the next gods (or the dark gods) are coming. Wonder Woman notes that sounds like Barbara rambling about welcoming the next gods after freeing herself from Urzkartaga.

Steve advises caution. It appears this "next gods" madness is affecting people going through a crisis of faith. Cheetah can''t be the only superhuman out there on shaky terms with their deities.

All of sudden, Wonder Woman is punched out of the sky by Supergirl, who claims Rao is dead and Wonder Woman is next.',
  'Reports of people, numbering in the tens of thousands, swearing off their gods while in the throes of violent bouts of insanity. Saying how the "next gods" will come. The "dark gods."',

  'Wonder Woman is fighting a mind-controlled Supergirl over the skies of Washington, D.C. As brawling, the Girl of Steel claims Wonder Woman summoned the dark gods from their own dimension. They know Diana will interfere with them so they sent Supergirl out to stop her.

As brawling, Wonder Woman tries to reason with Supergirl to no avail. Seeking answers, Diana manages to lasso Kara. In reaction, the younger hero smashes them against several buildings until Wonder Woman holds onto a rooftop and commands Supergirl tell her everything she knows about the dark gods.

On Greece, Jason has a meeting with the Fates to figure out how and why he''s wearing an armor endowed with the power of all gods. The Fates reveal Zeus foresaw the coming of the dark gods so he created that armor as an additional weapong against them. It was made for the Earth''s greatest champion, but he died before bestowing it upon Diana, and the rest of the pantheon minus Hera assumed it was meant for his son.

Jason considers to hand it over to Diana, but the Fates warn it''s bonded to his body and spirit now. He''s stuck with it forever. Jason protests he doesn''t feel worthy of it, but the three spirits reiterate he better learns quick. The dark gods are already on Earth and his sister needs him. Jason heads off at Hermes'' speed.

At the same time, the tracking systems on A.R.G.U.S. Central Command pick up four flying masses heading for D.C.

Back on Washington, D.C., Wonder Woman lays Supergirl gently down on a rooftop. When she demanded information, Supergirl just blacked out. Diana''s discussing the situation with Steve Trevor when Jason arrives at the place. Jason tries to explain about the armor and the dark gods when all four of them fly in through the blanket of clouds. They resemble giant stone monoliths. Red energy beams erupt from their eyes, and both warriors prepare for a new battle.

Suddenly, Wonder Woman is abducted by a pair of Star Sapphire Corps, and Jason is left to face the dark gods alone.',

Harley tries to convince the Enchantress but it is Rick who persuades her by mentioning the bombs implanted in each of their necks.

Harley also contacts the newest member, Hack, to help with the computers. Hack at the time was conversing with a digital Captain Boomerang who was trapped within the computer like "digital indigestion". Though Katana and other crazed troops find her, Boomerang manages to let her escape by slowing the inmates down with his robotic appendages.

Harley and the others ride upon the frozen Croc to the room where General Zod is awakening. Croc is released to slow his down but the Kryptonian is too powerful, Harley manages to sneak two electrical cables into Zod electrifying him and allowing Boomerang access. When the lever is flipped Boomerang''s power surges into Zod and resurrects Boomerang in the process.

  'The Daily Planet is facing problems. According to Ron Troupe, a blog called Urbanitis has posted an article that accuses the Daily Planet of bribing Superman into giving them exclusives, due to Superman''s relationship with Lois Lane. To solve this, Perry White fires photographer Sandeep and tasks him with talking with Jack Hoffman, the creator of Urbanitis, so that he can reveal what he knows. According to Perry, Sandeep cannot go to Urbanitis as a Daily Planet employee, since it would look like intimidation. Perry tells Sandeep that if he succeeds, he can have his old job back.

Sandeep goes to the Urbanitis stringers'' meeting and talks with Jack. When asked if he has evidence, Jack replies that he has pictures and discrepancies in the Planet''s finances. According to Jack, a fangirl sent them a picture about one of Superman''s cross-country stops.

Later, Sandeep informs Perry that Jack plans to post his evidence tomorrow. In that moment, Perry is met by Superman, who offers to help him with the Daily Planet''s problems. Perry declines, saying that Superman''s involvement would only make things worse. Superman accepts and flies away.

The next day, Jack meets with Perry and shows him a report showing that $20, 000 of unacounted for funding going into the Planet''s expense account every quarter for the past five years and vanishing again about a week after deposit. Perry replies that''s his money, saying that the Planet has been losing revenue for the last decade. The deposits come from his personal account and that they have been the difference between keeping the summer internship program and cutting it. Although it is not strictly legal, it is not bribing Superman. Perry says that Superman does not even carry money.

Jack then shows him the picture the fangirl sent to him. The picture shows Superman and Lois kissing, but Sandeef comes in and says that the woman in the picture is not Lois. This reveals Sandeep''s status as a mole to Jack. Sandeep then takes out a poster for a party that shows a boy dressed as Superman kissing a red-headed girl. Sandeep says that someone must have photoshopped Lois and Superman''s faces on the picture. This effectively makes Jack''s evidence rendundant.

Perry tells Jack that he wants two things from him. The first one if for Jack to post a public apology and retraction from his website no later than tonight, and Jack accepts. The second one if for Jack to join the summer internship next year. Perry says that Jack can be of great use for the Planet. He also gives Sandeep his old job back.',

  'The book starts out by introducing readers to Green Arrow and Black Canary while simultaneously introducing them to each other. For fans of their relationship this will be an amazing moment as their romance has been teased by DC Comics for a while now. The duo go out and stop a human trafficking operation but fail to learn who is behind it.

For the most part these first few issues are alright. They are not anything special, though this largely due to introductions taking precedence over plot, something common for the beginning of most stories. However, it is also weighed down by some odd interactions between Oliver and Dinah. The two go from being head over heels with each other to fighting, over the course of only two pages. It feels inauthentic and is definitely noticeable when reading.

Things start to significantly pick up as Oliver digs into the organization behind the human trafficking, the Ninth Circle. He is ambushed by an assassin, then betrayed and left for dead by his own sister. While the rest of the world thinks he is dead, he recovers and begins tracking the Ninth Circle while his concerned friends start tracking him.

This is the best part of the story. Our hero is betrayed and at the end of his luck, nothing seems to be going right. He needs to scrape and crawl his way back or else the evil he is fighting will win. It is gripping and action packed in a way that will keep readers at the edge of their seats. Eventually we see Oliver team up with his friends and go head to head with the Ninth Circle, completely destroying them in the process. It is an ending that required work to get to and one that definitely pays off.

In addition to the book’s great storytelling, it is worth mentioning that the themes and morals in this book are extremely well constructed as well. Green Arrow has always been an extremely liberal hero, so here we get to see that liberalism examined. Oliver discovers that he needs to play a more active role in his charity work or his money will be useless. Plus, the entire work is layered with references to Dante’s Inferno. Specifically, the Inferno involves betrayal and the major twists in this book involve Oliver being betrayed by his sister and business partner. Benjamin Percy clearly put some work into crafting this storyline and his efforts echo throughout the collection.',
  'It''s one thing to lose everything. It''s another to throw it all away yourself. If I hit this trigger, Oliver Queen will die. No money. No company. There will be nothing left... except Green Arrow.',

  'This issue is concerned with both the past and present story of Roy Harper. In the present Roy is driving back to Seattle after a long absence with the Titans. He makes a grand entrance, picking a fight with a local redneck type militia trying to keep more protesters from disrupting the building of a cascade pipeline called the Black Artery. Of course, the only problem is that this pipeline goes through sacred land on the Spokane Indian Reservation. If this sounds familiar, it’s obviously a take on the issue of the Dakota access pipeline protests. For those who aren’t up to speed on the issue, TL;DR: The US government wants to create an access pipeline across the land that belongs to a section of a Native American tribe’s burial grounds. The protesters believe this is a violation of Native culture as well as their rights. It was previously revealed that Roy Harper is Navajo, so it doesn’t come as much of a surprise that he’s returning for this. He contemplates the event surrounding the protests, the abuse from the military, and the sudden withdrawal of the majority of the protesters. An ominous message says to him; war is coming.

What we also know about Roy is that he’s had problems with addiction in the past. He above all people also knows what this has done to his relationships with family and friends. Roy’s motive is clear here; he wants to redeem himself it seems, to his own people. They are also reluctant to listen to him. Especially after an apparent event involving Roy that directly caused his surrogate father’s death.

Of course, before any kind of civil action can be taken, an attack comes from quad driving mercenaries called the Wild Dogs. The following battle that ensues is action packed and exciting. Natives on horseback and gun wielding mercs in quads and trucks? Yes, please. Once Ollie shows up, Roy loses all of his cool. What was most interesting about the ending panel wasn’t just that Roy seems to think Ollie has ruined the fight, but the close-up look we get at the pipe behind him and what it’s labeled: Queen Industries. Clearly, the Ninth Circle is behind this.
',
  'Oliver Queen and Roy Harper once patrolled the streets as Green Arrow and Speedy, but a massive falling-out left them estranged for years. Now, learn the truth about the tragic dissolution – and triumphant reunion – of one of comics'' most iconic super-duos as Green Arrow and Arsenal join forces once more!',

  'The look of Green Arrow has been a revelation since the start of Rebirth, from Nate Piekos of Blambot''s un-bordered word balloons to Otto Schmidt''s gorgeously-angled stylized art, somewhere between Phil Hester and Darwyn Cooke. Series co-artist Juan Ferreyra has offered fine similarity to Schmidt so far, but the book has often wanted for Schmidt; here, the artists trade-off outdoing one another, with Schmidt''s retro-hip figures and Ferreyra''s intricate two-page spreads and watercolor-like coloring, not to mention an exuberant action sequence involving a speeding armored truck. There is nary a false visual note in this book, and furthermore the artists raise some of the book''s best action sequences to near operatic levels.

So sweeping is Emerald Outlaw that Benjamin Percy''s got Green Arrow fighting a war on two fronts, if not more, both his enemy Cyrus Broderick siccing Malcolm Merlyn on him and Merlyn framing Green Arrow for multiple murders, and also the Vice Squad militia killing Seattle''s not-so-guilty. These two stories feed into one another exceptionally well, with Arrow Oliver Queen dealing with his own internal guilt along with external threats, and trying to win the trust of the police at a time his reputation''s all but shot. Within these two stories Percy introduces a bevy of new characters who populate the Seattle landscape, and in many ways the world-building of this story makes it feel like Percy''s first and not third Rebirth volume.

Plenty of new characters means plenty of opportunity for Percy to raise the body count, and I was floored when Merlyn''s arrows started flying in the first chapter, taking out both new characters and ones we met in the last two books. Actually very few new characters survive this book, and it goes to the shock of Percy bucking expectations; my mouth hung open when Oliver''s new ally Chief Westberg killed Vice Squad leader Notting to save them all, and then again when Oliver revealed his identity to Westberg only for Merlyn to kill him in the next scene. Even Percy''s Trump analogue Nate Domini doesn''t make it out alive when his change of heart and decision to help Oliver puts him in Broderick''s crosshairs.

  'In Kenilworth, New Jersey, a local Congressman is hosting a party in his condominium, celebrating his reelection. According to local While there, he receives a package and steps out onto the balcony to open the package. Once he sees what''s inside, he immediately steps over the railing, falling to his death. As he falls, the package is revealed to have been scandalous photos of himself. While Slade and Wintergreen have trouble navigating the city, they eventually locate the Congressman''s body and move to the next phase of their plan.

Clock King recounts the various aspects of man known as Slade Wilson, and wonders to himself which aspect was the person he truly was inside. He then turns his focus back to his captive: Matthew Bland, genocidal "President" of a nation in Sub-Saharan Africa. Tockman takes a moment to recap what Matthew has been up to. It was he who hired Deathstroke to kill him by secretly financing a group of his victims so that they could hire Slade without it tracing back to him. Secondly, he offered Slade permission to kill Tockman, who was living under his protection, in exchange for a favor. The favor was using some extra money from him to get a certain Congressmen who is against U.S. intervention in Bland''s country reelected. Then, after Slade kills Tockman, Bland would kill Slade. Essentially, Bland double-crossed him in order to double-cross Slade. However, Slade double-crossed him first. With the Congressman dead, Slade took the money for himself and mothballed Matthew''s plan. Now, he has no choice but to hope the man he wanted dead will come to save him.

In another part of Africa, Wintergreen, who was supposed to be dead, is now gathering the few belongings ha had while he was being imprisoned. He also chastises Slade for letting his decoy get killed, and recounts his kidnapping from his safe house in Vermont to Slade. While rifling through Wintergreen''s things, he finds the Ikon suit. Even though he wanted it destroyed, he dons it now as he has no suit. However, the suit is out of power. Using a rifle, Wintergreen charges it with few shots, then the two make their escape. As they head towards the entrance, Wintergreen gives Slade a rundown of the terrorists holding him. They then return to Slade''s escorts, who took the liberty of disposing the decoy body used to get in, along with his original uniform. The group returns to Clock King''s compound, where Ja Zaki is being held captive. Once there, Wintergreen enters alone and unarmed, and tries to negotiate a surrender. Clock King causes his age to begin fluctuating as a rebuttal.

Wintergreen flashes back to the past, where he walks into the Wilson home to find Grant and Joseph playing video games...while Slade and Adeline are upstairs beating the tar out of each other. Adeline is upset that Slade is always traveling with Wintergreen while she is stuck at home raising their children. Once the two stop fighting, Adeline declares her intent to divorce him.

Back in the present, Wintergreen''s age keeps fluctuating. However, Slade appears and shoots him, but he was only an illusion. Slade reveals the Clock Kings abilities are actually just parlor tricks. He then reveals his weakness, due to his old age, which he hides under his illusions, Clock King needed to be connected to an oxygen tank. Wintergreen finds the tank shoots the tank, causing an explosion that disrupts all of the illusions. While Clock King is struggling to breathe, he is shocked Slade abandoned his word not to kill him, but because Wintergreen fired the shots, his honor is intact. Once free, Bland is upset that Slade killed his Congressman. Slade simply warns him to leave his two escorts and their families alone and leaves.

While on the way out Wintergreen reveals that the Congressmen death will undo his political agenda, causing the U.S. to intervene and defend Ja Zaki''s enemies, and saving thousands of lives. Slade brushes it off, but Wintergreen tells him that the entire thing was a hallucination. Slade then punches him to convince him that he was wide awake. When he catches on, he begins ranting about the capture, their distress code Kenilworth, and ends by asking Slade where he was all that time. He sarcastically responds that he was golfing.

Later, Mattew and his men head to where the decoy Slade''s body was dumped. While inspecting the body, Matthew calls an unknown benefactor and tells them that his job was complete and demands he get his money. He then muses about the fact that someone paid a fortune just to get the world''s deadliest assassin to swap his uniform and put on the Ikon suit. He says that Slade has seriously angered someone, and wonders how it can benefit the Red Lion.',

  'In the past, a young Joseph Wilson is playing video games. Adeline then tells him she is leaving for a few days to track down his father, and to let his brother know. As she walks out, Joe responds that Grant told him Slade is never coming back. Now homw alone, he decides to throw a wild party. Two days later, as Adeline is returning home, she gets word from a friend that there is no trace of Slade anywhere. Upon entering, she finds her living room trashed, as Joseph never bothered to hide his activities. However, she notices a more pressing issue; a photo of Joseph with a blade to his throat pinned to the wall with a knife. Next to the picture is a message written in blood: Call me Deathstroke. She immediately calls Slade to tell him what is going on. Though he picks up, she can barely get a word out before he brushes her off and hangs up. Heading back out, she calls her friend to find information on Deathstroke, the man she believes kidnapped her son. It turns out Slade rebuffed his wife because he, Wintergreen, and their team are flying in a derelict plane towards an operation in Cambodia. Slade complains about Billy''s flying skills, Billy complains about flying a stolen junker, and the rest of the team fret about their inevitable crash and dealing with Khmer Rouge holdouts from the war. Billy reminds Isherwood that they were given this job to get Ms. Worth away from the holdouts. As they crash, Isherwood fears they will die, but Billy tells him of his plan to die of old age like a normal person.

In the present, Wintergreen walks into a pub in Edinburgh, gun in hand. Fredric, the bartender, immediately recognizes him, asks if this cliché moment is what it''s come to. Having been eight years since the Cambodia exfil, he hasn''t reached out since. He tells him he has been indisposed. Though unsatisfied with his answer, he offer a drink to Billy...and his friend. Billy explains why they are there; after faking his death to retire from their line of work, the actor he left in his place was murdered, and he was captured a short time after. The problem is only five people knew he was alive, and three of them are in this bar. Fredric is insulted that he and his ninja friend, easily recognized as Slade in the Ikon Suit, suspect him. He offers to tell him a story about a man named Racskowski, their old crewman.

Earlier, Slade traveled to Manchester to meet "Rax", but he finds a couple has rented out his house while he is on holiday. Slade convinces them to let him in, but when they try to kill him, he kills them. As he jumps out the window, he finds that Rax is already dead. Back at the pub, Fredric tells them that there are now only four of their crew left, with Isherwood being the only other man not present. Billy theorizes that Rax was tortured, but Fredric claims that no torture could make a mercenary like him talk. However, Isherwood, their cowardly inventor, could have ratted him out. Billy tells Fred that, he the recon man for their op, is still a suspect.

Fredric then flashes back to the Cambodia op, and remembers their goal; get Lillian, who was abandoned by British intelligence around the time gangsters working for the local drug cartel targeted her, out of the country. In the brothel, Fredric is asking an employee in Lillian''s brothel about the owner''s American sounding name. She ducks the question and tries to find him company, only to by the gangsters. Fredric asks for them to surrender, just as Isherwood snipes the closest thug to Fred. As the rest of the team enters, Fred goes to find Lillian, but things go sideways when he he is shot...by a little girl with silver hair. Wintergreen comes in after him, and he gets the girl to calm down and drop her gun. As he comforts her, Slade walks in, and he asks what he''s done.

Green Arrow and his team get themselves on this train because it’s the only way to get off the island that they have been stuck on for the past couple of issues; they need to get back to Seattle before a big shipment of drugs makes it there.
I love all the throwbacks to the old Green Arrow series that has been going on in this title. When I saw Eddie Fyers, I had an actual physical reaction; he’s one of my favorite side characters in the original run of Green Arrow. Adding to the feel good moments of nostalgia, the blending of action and comedy is also really well done in this issue.

Juan Ferreyra has done another fantastic job on this issue;.the panel layout is unique and a lot of fun. His coloring also really pulls everything together.

  'This issue opens with Ollie chopping wood in a nearby coastal forest. Recounting the recent events (pretty much everything that has happened in this series to-date), Ollie gets his new strategy firmly affixed in his mind. There''s plenty of intrigue being laid out here. And before it is all over, Ollie gets attacked, and that propels us forward to a hyper-amped twist in the plot''s climax.
Otto Schmidt''s art has been getting progressively better since this series kicked off near the end of 2015. Line-by-line, this is some of the best I have seen from him yet. But it is severely devalued by some messy fight choreography in the closing scenes; a number of panels where I was shaking my head, asking "what the heck is that?" or "where the heck did that come from?!" But other than that, there are some really nice full-page portraits, as well as some spiral panel layout landscape pages that played really well from a storytelling perspective. The Neal Adams / Alex Sinclair Variant Cover rocks. The car processional panel early in the issue''s opening pages is done very well, with some excellent blurring on the lights atop the police vehicles, a wash of light across the road that runs across the main path, and dozens of American flags in the picture. And finally the portrait of Oliver standing on a cliff-side, overlooking what I assume is Puget Sound at dusk, with tons of various oranges and light reds and shadow is really sharp.
Percy does some nice work here, playing on his dramatic chops in the opening pages with an appropriately determined intonation from Ollie. Then there is a great scene between Oliver and reporter friend, Victoria. It is a great play-scene full of emotion, as Victoria chooses to help the Green Arrow, a man she is clearly attracted to, despite his confirmation that he is with the Black Canary and that they are exclusive. I really liked the dialogue with Malcolm Merlyn as the fight goes hot in the book''s latter half, and the writing effect of having Ollie''s inner monologue woven in-between the dialog with Merlyn. But this section also houses my main detraction from the book and why it does not breakout as a superb issue for me. I get that they have been trying to align the comics and the TV shows more closely both here in The Green Arrow and also over in The Flash. It''s really more trying to make the books adopt some of the lore from the television shows. But what I wish is that they would just go full-bore with that, or entirely leave it alone. This middling thing of taking thematic queues from the show, but making it just slightly different; I''m not certain that works in favor of the comic at all. We get it here in the back-story of what is supposed to be Thea Queen in the comic, but is a character named differently, who becomes Red Arrow without ever having known Roy Harper. Ditto for John Diggle, who commits the final act in this issue that kind of broke the bank for me. Had it not been for that ending, this book would have been up in the type of score range that makes me add a series to my monthly recurring pull-list.',

  '“Emerald Outlaw” continues to explore Oliver Queen now living solely as Green Arrow, having had his “life” and his corporation stolen by Cyrus Broderick, his CFO. With the death of Oliver Queen he fully commits to being the Green Arrow while trying to clear his name and his father’s legacy. He also has to figure out who his enemies are.

Volume two, “Island of Scars”, dealt with villains such as the shapeshifting Yakusa boss, and the obscenely wealthy and powerful as they play political games. “Emerald Outlaw” explores another layer of evil, but instead of monsters and the obscenely rich doing bad things, it’s how the common man, who is just as capable of wreaking havoc in our communities.  A macro/micro storytelling approach for the politically and socially conscious Green Arrow.
The story kicks off with a corrupt cop, who’s abusing the very people he swore an oath to protect. I’m sure some readers believe it’s not the place of a comic book to make a statement on social issues; but thats what comics have been doing since their inception and Benjamin Percy is able to strike a balance — not taking a position and simply telling the story he’s here to tell, and he does it well.
This issue tackles police brutality, corrupt politicians, the changing demographic of Seattle, as well as the role of the media as the fifth estate in hyping up the state of affairs. While the big bad Ninth Circle remains in the background.

Said abusive cop goes rogue, gathering a group of goons called the Vice Squad. They believe it’s their job to get rid of the city’s undesirables without due process, and end up taking the idea of vigilantism too far; mass graves too far.  We do get a “good” cop to balance out the “bad” cops, by the name of Chief Westberg.
Add in a corrupt egoist running for Mayor, using a law and order type rhetoric against the Green Arrow in the media, and you start to wonder what else could go wrong for Oliver Queen. When you’re just as overwhelmed as Oliver is with all the people against him, we then get Malcolm Merlyn thrown into the mix.',
  'Tension in Seattle reaches fever pitch when the media begins to question Green Arrow''s involvement in a series of murders committed by an archer with unmatched skills. If the police can''t catch this mysterious archer, can Green Arrow and Black Canary? Plus, the rogue police officer Ollie humiliated in a viral video returns to take the law into his own hands.',

  'Green Arrow by Benjamin Percy and Otto Schmidt has easily been the most consistently great series to come out of Rebirth. Batman, Trinity, and Wonder Woman have all been awesome (in my opinion), but Green Arrow is the only one that hasn’t had a low point or an issue that I thought to myself, “This isn’t necessary…” Percey is just one of those writers that instantly captures that tone and nature of the character. Like Scott Snyder with Batman, Jason Aaron with Thor, or James Robinson with ANY Golden Age character. I honestly think Percy will easily go down as one of the best Green Arrow writers.

Since the very first issue of this series, Oliver Queen has been a Social Justice Warrior, and that had some controversy around it because even the term itself tends to be viewed, for some bizarre reason, negatively, and is often used sarcastically. But, as I said in my Green Arrow #1 review, Ollie has always, and should always, be a Social Justice Warrior. It just fits his nature. The great thing about this issue (and series) is that it tackles political issues head on and without remorse. Hell, the alternative villain, the mayor-to-be of Seattle who ran his campaign based on fear and hate, is the spitting image of Donald J. Trump. I have to give respect to Percy for guiding the story to a place so relevant to today’s topics.

When it comes to art, Otto Schmidt is one of my favorite artist working with DC Comics. The more that these guys put out, the better the work gets and it’s already fantastic work. Schmidt does a incredible job with the colors and line work on every page. In the intense fight scenes, everything is clearly defined and easy to locate. I personally love the uses of dark colors such as blues, oranges, and greens. Schmidt does a great job using the color scheme to capture the tone of the book. Along with colors, Schmidt also does a great job with the facial characteristics and body language of everyone in the book.',
  'Implicated in the killing of several high profile Seattleites, besieged by a murderous cabal of crooked cops and demonised by a mayoral candidate willing to tear the city apart to get what he wants, all seems lost for Green Arrow. That is, until help arrives in the form of a long-lost ally. It''s the return of Emiko Queen!',

  'The look of Green Arrow has been a revelation since the start of Rebirth, from Nate Piekos of Blambot''s un-bordered word balloons to Otto Schmidt''s gorgeously-angled stylized art, somewhere between Phil Hester and Darwyn Cooke. Series co-artist Juan Ferreyra has offered fine similarity to Schmidt so far, but the book has often wanted for Schmidt; here, the artists trade-off outdoing one another, with Schmidt''s retro-hip figures and Ferreyra''s intricate two-page spreads and watercolor-like coloring, not to mention an exuberant action sequence involving a speeding armored truck. There is nary a false visual note in this book, and furthermore the artists raise some of the book''s best action sequences to near operatic levels.

So sweeping is Emerald Outlaw that Benjamin Percy''s got Green Arrow fighting a war on two fronts, if not more, both his enemy Cyrus Broderick siccing Malcolm Merlyn on him and Merlyn framing Green Arrow for multiple murders, and also the Vice Squad militia killing Seattle''s not-so-guilty. These two stories feed into one another exceptionally well, with Arrow Oliver Queen dealing with his own internal guilt along with external threats, and trying to win the trust of the police at a time his reputation''s all but shot. Within these two stories Percy introduces a bevy of new characters who populate the Seattle landscape, and in many ways the world-building of this story makes it feel like Percy''s first and not third Rebirth volume.

Plenty of new characters means plenty of opportunity for Percy to raise the body count, and I was floored when Merlyn''s arrows started flying in the first chapter, taking out both new characters and ones we met in the last two books. Actually very few new characters survive this book, and it goes to the shock of Percy bucking expectations; my mouth hung open when Oliver''s new ally Chief Westberg killed Vice Squad leader Notting to save them all, and then again when Oliver revealed his identity to Westberg only for Merlyn to kill him in the next scene. Even Percy''s Trump analogue Nate Domini doesn''t make it out alive when his change of heart and decision to help Oliver puts him in Broderick''s crosshairs. 

The only survivor appears to be news reporter Victoria Much, whose crush on Oliver endears her to the audience immediately (I didn''t mind television Arrow''s Susan Williams as much as some, and Much reminds of Williams). At the same time, Schmidt colors a lovely late scene between Oliver and Much in prominent shades of red and green, leading me to wonder if Percy isn''t planting the seeds for a new iteration of Green Arrow''s Cupid villain ...',
  'The biggest GREEN ARROW epic since the start of the Rebirth era comes to a shattering conclusion when Oliver, Emiko and Black Canary intent against the deadly assassin terrorizing Seattle''s most prominent citizens. But [REDACTED] won''t go down without a fight – even if it takes all of Seattle with him.',

Superman gives Jimmy the key he received from the mayor and goes to stop Livewire. Superman is confused on why is Livewire has returned to open villainy when she decided to begin a new honest life after helping Superman defeating the Auctioneer. Superman tries to reason with her, but Livewire attacks him with lightning bolts. Also, she transforms into pure energy and moves through the city''s power grid to escape from Superman.

While Superman and Livewire fight, Jennings tries to escape the electric field, but she is shocked by the electricity and drops her Sunstone. Iron Munro tries to help her and touches the Sunstone, which gives Iron Munro visions of Superman''s recent tragedies. Jennings takes the Sunstone back.

To help Superman, Jimmy calls Dr. Serling Roquette of S.T.A.R. Labs and asks her for a way to stop Livewire. Dr. Roquette tells Jimmy that Livewire''s increased power is affecting her mind and that the only way to stop her is using a containment suit to dissipate Livewire''s excessive power. Superman intercepts the call with his super-hearing and goes to the Fortress of Solitude. There, he finds the suit he used when he was an energy being. He takes the suit to S.T.A.R. Labs, and Dr. Roquette modifies to suit to contain Livewire.

Livewire attacks Jimmy, but he straps the key to a wire and throws it to her. This weakens Livewire and dissipates the electric field, allowing the hostages to escape. Jennings escapes in the confusion. Livewire tries to attack the hostages, but Iron Munro protects them with his invulnerability. Superman then puts the modified suit on Livewire, which returns her power levels to normal.

Livewire is arrested, but she may not receive a hard sentence since she only damaged property and there were no injuries, and also Superman spoke in her favor.

Jimmy asks Superman why is he helping Livewire, and Superman answers that in America, everyone deserves a second chance.',
  'Well, maybe now Leslie will have a chance to find out. A second chance. That''s what America is about, really. That''s the American way. Life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness-- and second chances. None of us are forced into being anything we don''t want to be. When I was young, I knew that I would be someone different when I grew up. I would leave home and make a new life for myself. A new start, a second chance. When I first went to Metropolis, it was filled with people who''d done the same thing. People from all over America-- from all over the world-- who went to the city to live the lives they wanted, to be the people they wanted to be. That''s the idea America that was founded on, but it''s not just for people born here. It''s for everyone. And it''s for people like me and Livewire, too',

  'Superman meets with Supergirl and Superboy in the outskirts of Newsberg, Oregon. There, he informs them of his decision of stopping being Superman. Shocked, Kara and Conner try to talk Clark out of it, but Clark stands by his choice. Clark says that he will still help people, but in secret, just like he did on Smallville. Later, on a coffee shop on Portland, Clark calls Perry and recieves news that Lois will be on Seattle tonight. Then, he begins writing an article called "Must There Be a Superman?." The clerk introduces Clark to a Superman fan. The fan believes that Clark''s article is a joke, since he, after years of writing about Superman, must have an understanding of him. The fan takes Clark for a walk across Portland to ask people about Superman.

The fan asks a boy if he fears Superman, and the boy says no, reminiscing about the time when Superman stopped an invasion of robots. Clark says that some people distrust Superman, so the fan asks a woman if she distrusts Superman. The woman says no, because one time, he stopped an anti-alien campaign led by an alien. Then, the fan asks a man if he believes that Superman kills villains, and the man says no. The man recalls one time when Superman captured a gunman who threatened to kill everyone in a school. Instead of harming the gunman, Superman handed him to the police.

Still, Clark believes that some people resent Superman for having superpowers. The fan asks an Asian-American family if they resent him for that reason, and the family says no, recalling a time when he saved their daughter''s cat. Clark says that Superman can help people in secret. The fan agrees, but he also says that Superman is an aspirational figure and that allows him to help people become heroes in their own right.

Then, they listen to a news report that says that Lisa Jennings has taken Lois Lane hostage, saying that she will kill her if Superman does not appear. Clark leaves to confront her.',
  'You still don''t understand. Superman is just as as symbol as he is a hero. Maybe even more so. He can only save so many people, stop so many criminals, but everyone can be inspired by his example. Superman is an aspirational figure. He shows us to be better people ourselves by being the best person he can be.',

Superman fights Jennings across Seattle and asks her about her intentions. Jennings replies that she wants to make Superman suffer. To prevent their fight from causing destruction Superman activates the Lightning Door, an inter-dimensional portal that takes Superman and Jennings to the Still Zone.

There, Superman asks about Jennings why has she being following him through his journey. Jennings shows him the Sunstone her students found, saying that when Superman passed by the school she worked at, the Sunstone filled her with all of Superman''s feelings of sadness and doubt. This established a mental link between her and Superman, effectively transforming Jennings into the living embodiment of his depression. The Sunstone not only gave her Kryptonian powers, but it also gave Jennings the power to alter Superman''s dreams and affect the things he saw and heard.

Superman, feeling sorry for her, says that he will not let the destruction of New Krypton claim another victim. Jennings says that the Sunstone, being Kryptonian, cannot be destroyed. However, Superman says that his journey finally reminded him of why he became Superman in the first place. He touches the Sunstone and begins to fill it with his feelings of hope, destroying the Sunstone and rendering Jennings unconscious. Superman takes her out of the Still Zone and returns to normal space and time.

  'Superman saves Helen Phelps, an archeologist, from being hit by a truck in Ogden, Utah. He takes her to her trailer near Mt. Krowak. There, she and her crew had begun a dig on the mountain to find artifacts left by a civilization that established itself in the mountain before Paleo-Indians had. However, their research is being hampered by Centum Industries, a company that recently bought the mountain, wanting to use it as a radioactive waste site. Suddenly, Superman sees an S-signal in the sky, only visible to those who can see the ultraviolet end of the spectrum.

Superman flies to the source of the signal and finds Batman, who says that they haven''t had the chance to talk after his return. They remember the time when they met in Bhutran. There, Clark and Bruce met with Terri, Clark''s friend. After her father''s death, Terri had become the new Rhana Bhutra. She had asked for Clark and Bruce''s help to defend Bhutran from a group of Chinese soldiers led by Vandal Savage.

Vandal Savage had received information from Hassan-I-Sabbah, another immortal. Vandal believed that the inhabitants of Bhutran knew the location of Nanda Parbat, and he also believed that the monks of Rama Kushna could cure him from his cancer. To stop Vandal, Clark used rocks to block the pathway to Bhutran while Bruce used hypersonic speakers to summon a group of bats and attack the soldiers. After defeating the soldiers, Clark and Bruce expressed hope in working together again.

Superman and Batman then discuss about Superman''s recent emotional crisis. Batman believes that Superman can get past his doubts. Also, Batman says that he just bought Mt. Krowak, allowing Dr. Phelps and her crew to continue their research. Superman compliments Batman for creating Batman Incorporated, and Batman replies that Superman can also create his own squad of supermen. Batman then says that he will work in the shadows while Superman works in the light. The two then part ways.',

  'As Superman reaches Boulder, Colorado, he helps Saganowahna catch two criminals. After delivering the two criminals to the police, the two part ways, but not before Saganowahna tells Superman that the Manitou Stone may be Kryptonian in origin. Superman then reaches the city and a blur suddenly puts a Kryptonian armor on him. Superman takes the Kryptonian armor off and watches as the blur establishes Kryptonian structures across the city. Using his superhuman senses, Superman discover that the one behind all of this is the Flash, who is wearing a Kryptonian headband. Apparently, the headband is making Flash put Kryptonian structures over the city. Superman reaches the Flash and manages to take the headband off him. With the Flash free of the headband''s influence, the two get the city back to normal.

The two go to a restaurant, where they see the race between Superboy and Kid Flash. Superman explains to the Flash that the headband he was wearing contains a Kryptonian sunstone. During his time in New Krypton, Superman saw an interrogation device that could extract memories directly from a prisoner''s mind. The Flash believes that the device was not meant to be worn by anyone other than a Kryptonian. The Flash explains to Superman the he found the headband in a crater in Central City. As he put the headband on, his mind was overwhelmed by Kryptonian knowledge.

The Flash knew that Superman was the only one who could help him, so he made several references to the House of El while he was in Colorado. As the Flash finishes his explanation, Superman remarks that the Kryptonians believe morality to be a natural law. He tells Flash about something his adoptive father and a classmate of his told him during high school. Clark was grounded for skipping classes. He actually skipped classes to put out a fire in a neighboring county, but he did not tell anyone because he knew no one would believe him. As he was in detention, another kid was sent to detention: Lex Luthor. Clark would later figure out that Lex was sent to detention for trying to steal forty cakes from the school''s bake sale. Lex had done this in revenge for not being allowed to enter a fission-powered toaster in the science fair. As Clark and Lex talked, Clark said that his father told him that "There is right and wrong in the universe, and the distinction isn''t hard to make." However, Lex replied that the real distinction was between what works and what doesn''t. Lex then left the detention room, but not before telling Clark that he didn''t want to be punished for something he did. Clark would later learn that Lex was talking about pragmatism, about what''s expedient instead of what''s true.

As Superman and Flash leave the restaurant, Superman asks the Flash if he has wondered if he is doing the right thing by leaving a legacy behind. Flash admits that it was a little overwhelming at first, but now he is comfortable with the fact that if something happens to him, there will always be a Flash. He also says that Superman will also leave a legacy. Before the Flash leaves, Superman reminds him of what he said earlier, that he only saw a blur when he ran. Flash admits that he was joking. When he runs, he actually sees everything and everyone. Superman admits his recent feelings of self-doubt to Flash, who tells him that everything will be alright. The Flash then leaves, but not before telling Superman that he let Superman catch him and that he is still the Fastest Man Alive.',

  'The Superman Squad take Superman to their homebase, the Fortress of Solidarity, in the future. There, they explain that the Superman Squad is formed of several superpowered beings inspired by Superman''s heroic acts. Some members include Superman''s own descendants, either through blood-relation or adopted; beings that share his Kryptonian heritage, and unrelated beings who all decided to fight for justice. Some of them include non-human or non-Kryptonian members, such as Titano, protector of the Gorilla Galaxy; Superstar, a sentient star system, and Superego, a "good idea" who protects the realm of the collective unconscious.

The Superman Squad explain Superman that his recent emotional crisis is not just a matter of indecision, he is actually in danger of losing himself. During the events of New Krypton, Superman recovered his people and lost it again. In the aftermath, he suffered a depression and began doubting his own ideals and principles. Making matters worse, an outside influence is reinforcing that depression. The Superman Squad are confident that Superman will move past his doubts and be the hero he was.

The Superman Squad then leave Superman in Lincoln, Nebraska, in the present, where Superman will have an encounter with a woman who will be inspired by his heroic actions. Superman then flies to Lincoln, where a devastating storm is happening. Superman saves a school bus full of children, as he is being watched by Wonder Woman. Then, Superman notices that the storm is creating a flood. Also, a tornado is coming to town, forcing Superman to choose between stopping the tornado or saving the people from the flood. Fortunately, Diana appears and Superman asks her to save the people while he goes to stop the tornado. Although confused, Diana agrees. Superman uses a powerful clap to create a supersonic boom that dissipates the tornado.

Meanwhile, Diana puts the people in rooftops to protect them from the flood. Suddenly, she is attacked by Lisa Jennings, who claims she ruined everything. According to Jennings, Superman was supposed to make a difficult choice: sacrifice a few to save the many. However, Diana interfered and Superman was never forced to choose. Just as Jennings is about to attack, Diana punches her and prepares for battle. However, Jennings reminds her that there is still people at risk. Diana is forced to let Jennings go to save more people.

After the people is safe, Superman thanks Diana for helping him. Although Diana admits she wasn''t here to help since she is on a quest for vengeance, she was inspired by him to act like a hero. Diana then flies away, but not before warning Superman of a woman in black. Superman thinks that the woman in black may be the one she saw on his dream on Chicago. However, Superman puts those feelings aside so that he can help the panicked citizens. He is watched by Jennings, who says that Superman''s descent is only beginning.',

  'Brainiac''s ship lingers above New Krypton as his probes fight residents. General Zod learns 1/10th of the Kryptonians have died, and that Superman is on Brainiac''s ship held captive.

Lex Luthor mocks Superman without revealing his intentions, and Brainiac tells Superman he wants him to watch as Kandor is destroyed, to feel it, because Superman made Brainiac feel. In that moment, one of Brainiac''s machines nears Superman.

Tellus leads Mon-El to the ship, but once inside, he is faced with many versions of Koko. Luthor continues to mock Superman, and Brainaic tries to steal his thoughts as he experiences what is happening and learn his secrets. As Mon-El fights the Koko army, he is contacted by a telepathic bottle city race, who ask him to save them.

Mustering his will, Superman breaks free from the thought-stealing machine but Luthor threatens to shoot one of the bottle cities if Superman does not stand down. Mon-El appears, blasting Luthor''s hand with heat vision and disarming him. Mon-El takes the bottle city Luthor threatened, and has a sudden feeling this is what he was released to do.

Brainiac calls down more drones, distracting Superman and Mon-El long enough for Luthor to escape down a hatch.',
  'When I see villainy and horror unfolding here, Earth, anywhere... I''ve long stopped being surprised to find you or your hand at the heart of it, Luthor.',
